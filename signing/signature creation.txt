1. Signature Creation:
 jarsigner -storetype pkcs12 -keystore cert.p12 -tsa http://timestamp.comodoca.com ctts-3.5.0.jar "1"

 - cert.p12 is the code signing certificate
 - tsa has to be changed if not a comodo certificate is used (--> find other timestamp server)
 - "1" is the "alias". Can be found with: keytool.exe -list -storepass YourFilePassword -keystore KeystoreFileName -v
 
---> jar is automatically altered by the jarsigner
---> You need to add the bin folder of the JDK to your Windows path to be able to execute it

2. Signature Validation:
  jarsigner.exe -verify -verbose -certs ctts-3.5.0.jar
